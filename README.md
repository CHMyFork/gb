## FAQ

### What's the license?

These libraries are in the public domain. You can do anything you want with them. You have no legal obligation to do anything else, although I would appreciate attribution.

### If I wrap an gb library in a new library, does the new library have to be public domain?

No.

### Is this in the style of the [stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb)?

Yes. I think these libraries are brilliant and use many of these on a daily basis.
